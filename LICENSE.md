**SOME RANDOM LICENSE v9001.0.1**

Since I can't be bothered writing legal mumbo-jumbo, here it is in layman speak:

If you don't want Feds knocking down your door, read closely:

1. By accessing this awesome project, you agree to these terms.

2. Don't copy my project and sell it. Get your own.

3. You MAY modify the code and sell it though, with credit to me (@TheMatrixShibe).

4. You may use up to 25% of the assets. You can figure out the amount you can use yourself.

5. If you fork the code, this license MUST be kept.

There. Now go fly a kite.
